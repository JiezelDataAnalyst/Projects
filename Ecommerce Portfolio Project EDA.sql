-- Portfolio Project - Exploratory Data Analysis

-- E-commerce Dataset
-- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/e-commerce-dataset/data

-- In this Portfolio Project:
-- 1. Cleaning the dataset before data analysis.
-- 2. Exploratory Data Analysis. (In this dataset we are going to explore the data and find trends or patterns such as pricing trends, category performance over time, and payment method distribution.)

-- View dataset

SELECT * FROM ecommerce;     
  
-- Create staging table
-- First thing we want to do is create a staging table. This is the one we will work in,clean and explore the data.          

CREATE TABLE ecommerce_staging
LIKE ecommerce;

-- Inserting all the data from original table(ecommerce) into staging table(ecommerce_staging);

INSERT ecommerce_staging
SELECT *
FROM ecommerce;

-- View dataset

SELECT * FROM ecommerce_staging;

-- Let's clean first the data. We don't want to work with dirty dataset. To generate accurate and precise result we need to clean the data.

-- Standardizing Data

-- The purchase_date should be in date format. Let's modify the purchase_date from text to date;

ALTER TABLE ecommerce_staging
MODIFY COLUMN Purchase_Date DATE;

-- Modifying purchase_date resulting to error. Incorrect date value: '12-11-2024'
-- The format of dates is inconsistent. Let's use String to Date to format the purchase_date column;

SELECT Purchase_Date,
STR_TO_DATE(Purchase_Date,'%d-%m-%Y')
FROM ecommerce_staging;

UPDATE ecommerce_staging
SET Purchase_Date=STR_TO_DATE(Purchase_Date,'%d-%m-%Y')
WHERE Purchase_Date != '2024-11-12';

-- In above query, date value: '2024-11-12' is already in correct format, so I filtered that specific date.

-- Trying to modify again the purchase_date column...

ALTER TABLE ecommerce_staging
MODIFY COLUMN Purchase_Date DATE;
-- Successfully modified!

-- Removing some unnecessary letters and symbols in some column, in this case it will be more readable

ALTER TABLE ecommerce_staging
RENAME COLUMN `Price (Rs.)` TO Price;

ALTER TABLE ecommerce_staging
RENAME COLUMN `Discount (%)` TO Discount;

ALTER TABLE ecommerce_staging
RENAME COLUMN `Final_Price(Rs.)` TO Final_Price;

-- Treating/Removing NULLS
-- Let's identify nulls first in each column;

SELECT 
	SUM(CASE WHEN User_ID IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS nullcount_User_ID,
	SUM(CASE WHEN Product_ID IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS nullcount_Product_ID,
	SUM(CASE WHEN Category IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS nullcount_Category,
	SUM(CASE WHEN Price IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS nullcount_Price,
	SUM(CASE WHEN Discount IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS nullcount_Discount,
	SUM(CASE WHEN Final_Price IS NULL THEN 1 ELse 0 END) AS nullcount_Final_Price,
	SUM(CASE WHEN Payment_Method IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS nullcount_Payment_Method,
	SUM(CASE WHEN Purchase_Date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS nullcount_Purchase_Date
FROM ecommerce_staging;

-- Turns out there are nulls in User_ID and other columns.
-- To verify if there are nulls...

SELECT *
FROM ecommerce_staging
WHERE User_Id IS NULL;

-- The null values appear in multiple columns within the same rows, so we can delete these nulls.

DELETE
FROM ecommerce_staging
WHERE User_ID IS NULL;

-- Checking if we successfully deleted the nulls

SELECT *
FROM ecommerce_staging
WHERE User_Id IS NULL;

-- Let's check for duplicates

SELECT *
    FROM (
        SELECT User_ID, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
            PARTITION BY User_ID, Product_ID, Category, Price, Discount, Final_Price, Payment_Method, Purchase_Date
            ORDER BY User_ID
        ) AS row_num
        FROM ecommerce_staging
		) AS temp;

-- The ones that we want to delete are the row number > 1 beacuse these are the real duplicates

SELECT *
    FROM (
        SELECT User_ID, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
            PARTITION BY User_ID, Product_ID, Category, Price, Discount, Final_Price, Payment_Method, Purchase_Date
            ORDER BY User_ID
        ) AS row_num
        FROM ecommerce_staging
		) AS temp
WHERE row_num>1;

-- No duplicates

-- Our data is now clean

-- We can now proceed to EDA

SELECT * FROM ecommerce_staging;

-- Sales Analysis

-- Total Revenue
-- How much e-commerce generated in sales in 2024?

SELECT ROUND(SUM(Final_Price),2) AS Total_Revenue
FROM ecommerce_staging;

-- How many transactions were made for the whole year?

SELECT COUNT(*) AS transaction_count
FROM ecommerce_staging;

-- How many transactions were made per customer?
 
SELECT User_ID, COUNT(*) As transaction_count
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY User_ID;

-- Average Transaction Value(ATV)
-- What is the average spending per unique user?

SELECT ROUND(SUM(Final_Price)/COUNT(DISTINCT(User_ID)),2) AS ATV
FROM ecommerce_staging;

-- Sales Trend Over Time

-- Monthly Sales Trend

-- Which month is the most profitable and which month is the least profitable?

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(Purchase_Date,'%M') AS Month,ROUND(SUM(Final_Price),2) AS Monthly_Sales
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Monthly_Sales DESC;
-- By sorting the data by Total_Revenue, we can see that the month of October had the highest sales, whereas the November had the least sales.

-- Which category performs best each month?

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(Purchase_Date,'%M') AS Month, 
    Category, 
    ROUND(SUM(Final_Price),2) AS Monthly_Sales
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY Month, Category
ORDER BY Month, Monthly_Sales DESC;

-- Weekly Sales Trend

-- Which week has the highest sales and which week generates least sales?

SELECT WEEK(Purchase_Date,7) AS ISO_Weeknumber,ROUND(SUM(Final_Price),2) AS Weekly_Sales
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY ISO_Weeknumber
ORDER BY Weekly_Sales DESC;
-- By sorting by Total_Revenue, we can see that Week 16 had the highest sales and week 47 had the least sales.

-- What is the average sales per week?

SELECT 
    WEEK(Purchase_Date,7) AS ISO_Weeknumber,
    ROUND(SUM(Final_Price), 2) AS Weekly_Sales,
    ROUND(AVG(SUM(Final_Price)) OVER (), 2) AS Avg_Weekly_Sales
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY ISO_Weeknumber
ORDER BY ISO_Weeknumber;

-- Which category performs best each week?

SELECT WEEK(Purchase_Date,7) AS ISO_Weeknumber,Category,ROUND(SUM(Final_Price),2) AS Weekly_Sales
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY ISO_Weeknumber,Category
ORDER BY ISO_Weeknumber,Weekly_Sales DESC;

-- Category by Sales and Transaction
-- How many transactions were made per category and which category generates the highest sales?

SELECT Category, ROUND(SUM(Final_Price),2) AS Total_Revenue,COUNT(*) AS Total_Transaction
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC; 
-- Clothing had a total of 531 transactions and was the most profitable category, while electronics had a 498 transactions and was the least profitable category.

-- Payment method Analysis

-- Payment method by revenue and transaction
-- What is the most used payment method?

SELECT Payment_Method, ROUND(SUM(Final_Price),2) AS Total_Revenue, COUNT(*) AS Total_Transaction
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY Payment_Method
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
-- ORDER BY Total_Transaction DESC;

-- Credit Card is the most used and Cash on Delivery is the least used payment method.
-- Also, credit card have the most number transaction and the cash on delivery has the lowest

-- Discount vs Sales
-- Which discount generates the highest sales?

SELECT Discount, ROUND(SUM(Final_Price),2) AS Total_Revenue
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY Discount
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
-- A discount range of 0-15% generates the highest sales, whereas a discount range of 25-50% generates the least.

-- Category-Level Trends
-- Let's find out the category that generate highest sales by applying discount to price
-- How discounts impact different product categories?

SELECT Category,Discount,ROUND(SUM(Final_Price),2) AS Total_Revenue, COUNT(*) AS Total_Transaction
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY Category, Discount
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
-- With a discount of 30% the electronics category had the highest sales and by applying 50% discount the books category had the least sales.

-- How many transactions was made in each discounted price?

SELECT Discount, COUNT(*) AS Total_Transaction
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY Discount
ORDER BY Total_Transaction DESC;
-- Discount from 0-15% had the highest count of transaction while 25-50% had the least count.

-- Digging deeper on our dataset, we can also analyze time-based trends.

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(Purchase_Date,'%M')  AS Month, 
    Discount, 
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Transaction, 
    ROUND(SUM(Final_Price), 2) AS Total_Revenue
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY Month, Discount
ORDER BY Month, Total_Revenue DESC;

-- Understanding how discounts perform across different months can help optimize promotions.
-- This shows how discounts impact transactions and revenue throughout the year.

-- Creating View to store data for later vizualization

CREATE VIEW category_revenue_transaction AS
SELECT Category, ROUND(SUM(Final_Price),2) AS Total_Revenue,COUNT(*) AS Total_Transaction
FROM ecommerce_staging
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC; 

-- Let's query our view

SELECT *
FROM category_revenue_transaction;

-- Conclusion: Based on the data, increasing discounts does not lead to higher sales. Instead of relying on discounting, the business may benefit from optimizing other factors such as customer engagement, product positioning, or targeted marketing strategies.
